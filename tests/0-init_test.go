	Testing goals, in order:

	1) automatically parallel on the terminal
	2) zero-ish overhead
	3) tolerable syntax
	4) able to both hit a testing infra, or replay locally.


	For goal #1, Gunit seems to be the best-equipped to handle things, and there's some agreement on that:

	> I know that I'm the creator of GoConvey and all, but I've actually moved to gunit,
	> which uses t.Parallel() under the hood for every test case. - @mdwhatcott
	> https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/issues/360

	For goal #4, my plan is to incorporate go-vcr:
	https://github.com/dnaeon/go-vcr

	The implementation throws requests in YAML files, which... eh, let's try it maybe.
	There will have to be some setup trickery to transparently hit live or recorded.
	I think the vcr transport should handle that.


	Test requirements:

	1) Each test works independent of any preexisting state, or lack thereof. Only a working, root API key is required.
	2) Ideally tests can clean up after themselves, but this is not required.

	Please keep these goals and requirements in mind when modifying this package.


	There are instances where context creation could/should be handed off to a struct setup - right now, those are instead handled by "context" functions. This isn't a perfect layout if we had a larger test suite, but seems to work fine for now. Let's leave it until & unless it becomes unbearable.

// TestSuite fires off gunit.
//
// Gunit will look at various function name prefixes to determine behavior:
//
//   "Test": Well, it's a test.
//   "Skip": Skipped.
//   "Long": Skipped when `go test` is ran with the `short` flag.
//
//   "Setup":    Executed before each test.
//   "Teardown": Executed after  each test.
//
// Functions without these prefixes are ignored.
